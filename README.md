## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I would continue to explore flexbox and would love to learn CSS grid for making responsive layouts.

### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow CSS Generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - This helped me to generate the box-shadow for the container and the button as well.
